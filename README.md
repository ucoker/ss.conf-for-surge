Make sure edit `ServerConfig.txt` first to add your server infomation!

change your ss server config, like server ip, server port, and your password.

```ini
[Proxy]
ðŸ’ŠDIRECT = direct
ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡°HK = custom,your_server_here,your_port_here,aes-256-cfb,your_password_here,https://github.com/R0uter/ss.conf-for-surge/raw/master/ss.module
ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬SG = custom,your_server_here,your_port_here,aes-256-cfb,your_password_here,https://github.com/R0uter/ss.conf-for-surge/raw/master/ss.module
ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µJP = custom,your_server_here,your_port_here,aes-256-cfb,your_password_here,https://github.com/R0uter/ss.conf-for-surge/raw/master/ss.module
ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸US = custom,your_server_here,your_port_here,aes-256-cfb,your_password_here,https://github.com/R0uter/ss.conf-for-surge/raw/master/ss.module
```
    
Then you need to edit proxy group for auto speed test function.

```ini
[Proxy Group]
ChinaProxy = select,ðŸ’ŠDIRECT,ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡°HK,ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬SG,ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µJP,ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸US
Proxy = select,ðŸ’ŠDIRECT,@Auto,ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡°HK,ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬SG,ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µJP,ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸US
@Auto = url-test,ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡°HK,ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬SG,ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µJP,ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸US,url=http://www.gstatic.com/generate_204
